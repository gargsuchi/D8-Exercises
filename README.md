# D8-Exercises

Blocks Exercise.

Given that we fulfil the steps defined n the exercise:
Create a Block type called “Stock Exchange Rate Card”
Company Name
Symbol
Last Price
Change
Create Instances of the block with different sets of values and place them at different spots on the site.
Example values - (Apple, AAPL), (Bank of America,BAC), (Transocean, RIG), (Freeport, FCX).  (Ignore the Last Price and Change fields’ values, we will be dealing them in next step).

This repo contains a module <strong>suchi_blocks</strong> which when enabled has a hook_cron which does the needful.
